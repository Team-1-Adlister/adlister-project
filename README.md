# adlister-project
This project is designed to be a clone of craigslist. 
It will allow the user to login from the home page and be directed throughout the site allowing the user to create ads, view ads, update current listings and delte ads.
Once the user is logged into the page they should be redirected to an ads index page.
The user can search through the ads.
The users ads will be listed on their profile page.
Finally the user will be intentionally redirected according to their activity.
